{Implementation}
\section{Chapter Overview}
In this chapter we will dive into the implementation details of the CNAS's virtual counter, and the different technologies used to build the system such as Version control tool GitHub, the web Development framework Laravel and the other web technologies that gave us the possibility to create an efficiant web based application. 
\section{Introduction to Git and GitHub as a Version Control Tool}
Software Development requires the management of a big sets of files and assets which are in a frequent change, as developers we need a tool that allows the administration of those files and keep a constent updates on them, thats why Git came handy for giving us the possibility to do such task with ease and flexibility. At its core, Git is a tool that allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project, while keeping track of all changes made to the code and files over time.
