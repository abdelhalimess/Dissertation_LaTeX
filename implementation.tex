   \begin{verbatim}
    laravel new your-project-name 
   \end{verbatim}
   
   Replace "your-project-name" with the desired name for your project. This command will create a new directory with the specified project name and install the necessary files and dependencies.

\item \textbf{Test your installation:}
  
Change into the project directory:
\begin{verbatim}
    cd your-project-name
\end{verbatim}
   
Start the local development server by running the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
    php artisan serve
\end{verbatim}
  By default, the development server will start on (\url{http://localhost:8000}) 
  
  Open your web browser and visit that URL. If you see the Laravel welcome page, it means your installation was successful. 
  \item \textbf{PHP configuration:}
  
  Open the PHP configuration file (php.ini) on your system. The location of this file may vary depending on your operating system and PHP installation.
 
  Ensure that the following PHP extensions are enabled by uncommenting their respective lines (remove the semicolon ";" at the beginning of the line if present):
 \begin{verbatim}
    extension=fileinfo
    extension=openssl
    extension=pdo_mysql
 \end{verbatim}
 \newpage
 \item \textbf{Creating the ".env " file :}

 Laravel comes with a `.env.example' file by default. 
 \begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env' by running the following command:
    \begin{verbatim}
       cp .env.example .env 
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Setting up the environment variables:
     
    Open the `.env' file in a text editor.

    Update the variables according to your development environment. For example, you might need to set the database credentials:
\begin{verbatim}
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql

    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
\end{verbatim}

You can also configure other variables like the application URL, mail settings, caching drivers, and more. Refer to the comments in the `.env.example' file or Laravel's documentation for more information on available options.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Generating the application key: }

Laravel requires an application key for secure encryption and other purposes. 

Run the following command to generate the key:
\begin{verbatim}
php artisan key:generate
\end{verbatim}
\item \textbf{Protecting sensitive information:}

   Ensure that the .env file is not publicly accessible. It should be kept outside of your version control system or any public directories.
    
   If you deploy your application to a production server, you may need to set the environment variables directly on the server or through the server's configuration management tools.
 \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Laravel directory structure}

In a Laravel project, the directory structure is designed to provide a clear organization for your application's files. Understanding the key directories and files will help you navigate and manage your Laravel project effectively. Here's an explanation of the purpose of each directory and some important files:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
Understanding the purpose of each directory and file in a Laravel project will help you navigate and locate the appropriate locations for adding or modifying code, configurations, and assets. It's important to maintain the integrity of the directory structure while organizing your code and assets within the appropriate directories.
\subsection{Routing}

Routing is an essential aspect of web development, and Laravel provides a powerful and flexible routing system. Here's an explanation of routing in Laravel, including how to define routes, work with route parameters, and utilize route grouping and naming.

Routing in Laravel refers to the process of mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific actions or handlers within your application. It determines how different URLs are handled and defines the endpoints through which users can access various functionalities of your application.

In Laravel, routes are typically defined in the `routes` directory, specifically the `web.php` and `api.php` files.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Basic route definition:} 
    
    A basic route is defined using the `Route` facade's methods, such as `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete`.
    
    \medskip Here's an example of a basic route definition:
    \begin{verbatim}
        Route::get('/home', function () {
            return 'Welcome to the home page!';
            });       
         \end{verbatim}
     
   This route responds to the `GET` request to the `/home` URL and returns the specified message.

 \item \textbf{Route parameters:}
   You can define routes with parameters that are passed as segments in the URL.
   
   \medskip Here's an example of a route with a parameter:
     \begin{verbatim}
        
        Route::get('/users/{id}', function ($id) {
            return 'User ID: ' . $id;
            });
        \end{verbatim}

    This route matches URLs like `/users/1`, `/users/2`, etc., and the parameter `{id}` is passed to the route closure as an argument.

\item \textbf{Route grouping and naming:}

Laravel allows you to group related routes and assign names to them for easy referencing and organization.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Route grouping:}
    
    Route grouping allows you to apply common attributes or middleware to a group of routes.
    
    \medskip Here's an example of route grouping with a shared middleware:
\begin{verbatim}
    
        Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
            Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
                return 'Welcome to the dashboard!';
                });
                Route::get('/profile', function () {
                    return 'Welcome to your profile!';
                    });
                    });
                    
    \end{verbatim}
   In this example, the routes `/dashboard` and `/profile` are grouped together and share the `auth` middleware, which ensures that only authenticated users can access them.

    \item \textbf{Route naming:}
   
    Assigning names to routes helps in referencing them within your application, such as generating URLs or redirecting to specific routes.
    
    \medskip Here's an example of naming routes:
    \begin{verbatim}
        
        Route::get('/posts', function () {
            return 'List of posts';
            })->name('posts.index');
            
            Route::get('/posts/{id}', function ($id) {
                return 'Post ID: ' . $id;
                })->name('posts.show');
            \end{verbatim}
                
            In this example, the routes `/posts` and `/posts/{id}` are named as `posts.index` and `posts.show`, respectively. These names can be used later to generate URLs or redirect to these routes.
            
            By understanding and utilizing routing in Laravel, you can define the endpoints for your application, handle various HTTP methods, work with dynamic route parameters, group related routes, and assign names for easy referencing. Laravel's routing system provides the flexibility and convenience required to build robust and maintainable web applications.
        \end{itemize}
 \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Controllers}

Controllers play a crucial role in Laravel applications as they handle the logic and actions associated with different routes. Here's an explanation of creating and using controllers in Laravel, defining controller methods and actions, and understanding the separation of concerns between routes and controllers.

The creation of an controller is done by the following artisan command: 
\begin{verbatim}
   php artisan make:controller
\end{verbatim}

For instance, to create the user controller we used the following command: 
\begin{verbatim}
    php artisan make:controller UserController 
\end{verbatim}

This command will generate a new `UserController` class in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory.
