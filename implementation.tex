Laravel requires a web server and a database to run. You can use popular web servers like Apache or Nginx, along with databases like MySQL or SQLite.
  
Ensure that your web server and database server are properly installed and configured. If needed, consult their respective documentation for installation and setup instructions.
\newpage
\item \textbf{Initialize a new Laravel project:}
 
Once Laravel is installed and your development environment is set up, you can create a new Laravel project.
  
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
  Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:
   \begin{verbatim}
    laravel new your-project-name 
   \end{verbatim}
   
   Replace "your-project-name" with the desired name for your project. This command will create a new directory with the specified project name and install the necessary files and dependencies.

\item \textbf{Test your installation:}
  
Change into the project directory:
\begin{verbatim}
    cd your-project-name
\end{verbatim}
   
Start the local development server by running the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
    php artisan serve
\end{verbatim}
  By default, the development server will start on (\url{http://localhost:8000}) 
  
  Open your web browser and visit that URL. If you see the Laravel welcome page, it means your installation was successful. 
  \item \textbf{PHP configuration:}
  
  Open the PHP configuration file (php.ini) on your system. The location of this file may vary depending on your operating system and PHP installation.
 
  Ensure that the following PHP extensions are enabled by uncommenting their respective lines (remove the semicolon ";" at the beginning of the line if present):
 \begin{verbatim}
    extension=fileinfo
    extension=openssl
    extension=pdo_mysql
 \end{verbatim}
 \newpage
 \item \textbf{Creating the ".env " file :}

 Laravel comes with a `.env.example' file by default. 
 \begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env' by running the following command:
    \begin{verbatim}
       cp .env.example .env 
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Setting up the environment variables:
     
    Open the `.env' file in a text editor.

    Update the variables according to your development environment. For example, you might need to set the database credentials:
\begin{verbatim}
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
\end{verbatim}

You can also configure other variables like the application URL, mail settings, caching drivers, and more. Refer to the comments in the `.env.example' file or Laravel's documentation for more information on available options.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Generating the application key: }

Laravel requires an application key for secure encryption and other purposes. 

Run the following command to generate the key:
\begin{verbatim}
php artisan key:generate
\end{verbatim}
\item \textbf{Protecting sensitive information:}

   Ensure that the .env file is not publicly accessible. It should be kept outside of your version control system or any public directories.
    
   If you deploy your application to a production server, you may need to set the environment variables directly on the server or through the server's configuration management tools.
 \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Laravel directory structure}

In a Laravel project, the directory structure is designed to provide a clear organization for your application's files. Understanding the key directories and files will help you navigate and manage your Laravel project effectively. Here's an explanation of the purpose of each directory and some important files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{app:}
        Contains the core application code, including controllers, models, and other PHP classes specific to your application's domain logic.

    \item \textbf{bootstrap:}
        Contains the files responsible for bootstrapping the Laravel framework and initializing the application environment.

    \item \textbf{config:}
        Contains configuration files for various aspects of your application, such as database connections, caching, mail settings, and more.

    \item \textbf{database:}

    \item \textbf{composer.json and composer.lock:}
        These files manage the project's dependencies using Composer, a PHP dependency manager.
        composer.json lists the project's dependencies and defines autoloading rules.
        composer.lock locks the versions of the dependencies to ensure consistent installations.

    \item \textbf{artisan:}
        The command-line interface (CLI) tool for executing various commands within your Laravel application.
        Allows you to run tasks such as running migrations, generating code, and running tests.
\end{itemize}
Understanding the purpose of each directory and file in a Laravel project will help you navigate and locate the appropriate locations for adding or modifying code, configurations, and assets. It's important to maintain the integrity of the directory structure while organizing your code and assets within the appropriate directories.
\subsection{Routing}

Routing is an essential aspect of web development, and Laravel provides a powerful and flexible routing system. Here's an explanation of routing in Laravel, including how to define routes, work with route parameters, and utilize route grouping and naming.

Routing in Laravel refers to the process of mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific actions or handlers within your application. It determines how different URLs are handled and defines the endpoints through which users can access various functionalities of your application.

In Laravel, routes are typically defined in the `routes` directory, specifically the `web.php` and `api.php` files.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Basic route definition:} 
    
    A basic route is defined using the `Route` facade's methods, such as `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete`.
    
    \medskip Here's an example of a basic route definition:
    \begin{verbatim}
        Route::get('/home', function () {
            return 'Welcome to the home page!';
            });       
         \end{verbatim}
     
   This route responds to the `GET` request to the `/home` URL and returns the specified message.

 \item \textbf{Route parameters:}
   You can define routes with parameters that are passed as segments in the URL.
   
   \medskip Here's an example of a route with a parameter:
     \begin{verbatim}
        
        Route::get('/users/{id}', function ($id) {
            return 'User ID: ' . $id;
            });
        \end{verbatim}

    This route matches URLs like `/users/1`, `/users/2`, etc., and the parameter `{id}` is passed to the route closure as an argument.

\item \textbf{Route grouping and naming:}

Laravel allows you to group related routes and assign names to them for easy referencing and organization.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Route grouping:}
    
    Route grouping allows you to apply common attributes or middleware to a group of routes.
    
    \medskip Here's an example of route grouping with a shared middleware:
\begin{verbatim}
    
        Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
            Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
                return 'Welcome to the dashboard!';
                });
                Route::get('/profile', function () {
                    return 'Welcome to your profile!';
                    });
                    });
                    
    \end{verbatim}
   In this example, the routes `/dashboard` and `/profile` are grouped together and share the `auth` middleware, which ensures that only authenticated users can access them.

    \item \textbf{Route naming:}
   
    Assigning names to routes helps in referencing them within your application, such as generating URLs or redirecting to specific routes.
    
    \medskip Here's an example of naming routes:
    \begin{verbatim}
        
        Route::get('/posts', function () {
            return 'List of posts';
            })->name('posts.index');
            
            Route::get('/posts/{id}', function ($id) {
                return 'Post ID: ' . $id;
                })->name('posts.show');
            \end{verbatim}
                
            In this example, the routes `/posts` and `/posts/{id}` are named as `posts.index` and `posts.show`, respectively. These names can be used later to generate URLs or redirect to these routes.
            
            By understanding and utilizing routing in Laravel, you can define the endpoints for your application, handle various HTTP methods, work with dynamic route parameters, group related routes, and assign names for easy referencing. Laravel's routing system provides the flexibility and convenience required to build robust and maintainable web applications.
        \end{itemize}
 \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Controllers}

Controllers play a crucial role in Laravel applications as they handle the logic and actions associated with different routes. Here's an explanation of creating and using controllers in Laravel, defining controller methods and actions, and understanding the separation of concerns between routes and controllers.

The creation of an controller is done by the following artisan command: 
\begin{verbatim}
   php artisan make:controller
\end{verbatim}

For instance, to create the user controller we used the following command: 
\begin{verbatim}
    php artisan make:controller UserController 
\end{verbatim}

This command will generate a new `UserController` class in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory, which will be and empty class. 

In order to use the controller we must define its methods, it represent the actions that can be performed on a resource. These methods are responsible for processing requests, interacting with models or other methods, and returning appropriate responses and views.

\medskip Here is an example of the controller created in our application:
\begin{verbatim}
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

     class UserController extends Controller
     {
         public function index()
         {
             // Retrieve users from the database
             $users = User::all();

             // Return a view with the users
             return view('users.index', compact('users'));
         }

         public function show($id)
         {
             // Retrieve a specific user from the database
             $user = User::findOrFail($id);

             // Return a view with the user details
             return view('users.show', compact('user'));
         }
     }
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assigning controller to route:}
    
    \medskip Controllers and Routes are two highly related components in the application system, that's why we need to make them communicate with each other and that's by Assigning the controllers to the specific appropriate routes, the following step show how that can be done.
    
    To assign a controller to a specific route, we move to the routes directory, specifically in the 'web.php' file and create the following code:
    \begin{verbatim}
        use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;
        
        Route::get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
        Route::get('/users/{id}', [UserController::class, 'show']);
    \end{verbatim}
    In this example, the `index` method of the `UserController` will be executed when the `/users` route is accessed, and the `show` method will be executed for `/users/{id}`.

    Laravel also provides a more expressive syntax using the `Route::controller` method to bind all routes for a controller automatically. and that's by using the resource tag.
\item \textbf{Separation of concerns between routes and controllers:}

Laravel follows the principle of separation of concerns, where routes and controllers have distinct responsibilities:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Routes:}
    
    Routes define the URL patterns and HTTP methods that trigger specific actions in your application,
    they provide a mapping between incoming requests and the appropriate controller method or closure.
   
    Routes are responsible for handling the request lifecycle, middleware application, and route-specific logic.
    \item \textbf{Controllers:}
    
     Controllers encapsulate the application logic related to processing requests and generating responses,
     They handle the business logic, interact with models or services, and prepare the data to be presented to the user using views.
    
     Controllers promote code reusability and maintainability by keeping the route definitions concise and focused on routing concerns.
\end{enumerate}
By separating routes and controllers, you achieve a clean and modular structure for your application. Routes define the endpoints and how to handle them, while controllers centralize the related logic and actions. This separation promotes code organization, improves maintainability, and allows for easier testing and reuse of controller methods across different routes.
\end{itemize}

\medskip Using controllers in Laravel helps you manage the complexity of your application, adhere to the principles of MVC architecture, and ensure a clear separation of concerns between different components of your application.
\subsection{Views and Blade templates}
   
Views and Blade templates are crucial components in Laravel that handle the presentation layer of your application. They allow you to separate the UI (User-Interface) logic from the rest of your code and provide a flexible way to generate and render HTML. In this section we will delve into the explanation of views and templates in Laravel, including creating and rendering views, and working with the Blade templating engine.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{views and templates:}
    
    Views in Laravel are responsible for presenting the data to the user. They contain the HTML markup, CSS styles, and placeholders where dynamic data can be inserted. Templates, on the other hand, are reusable layouts that define the overall structure and common elements of multiple views.
    \item \textbf{Creating and rendering view:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Creating the view:}
        
        Views are typically stored in the `resources/views` directory, to create a view, you can simply create a new Blade template file with the `.blade.php` extension.

        ///////SCREEN SHOT/////////
        \item \textbf{Rendering a view:}
        
        To render a view, you can use the `view` helper function or the `View` facade.
        
        Here's an example of rendering the `welcome` view:
        \begin{verbatim}
            return view('welcome');
        \end{verbatim}
        This code will locate and render the `welcome.blade.php` view file.
        \item \textbf{Passing data to views:}
        
        You can pass data from your controller to the view by chaining the `with` method or using the second argument of the `view` function.
        Here's an example of passing data to the view:
        \begin{verbatim}
            $user = User::find(1);
            return view('profile')->with('user', $user);
        \end{verbatim}
        In the `profile.blade.php` view, you can access the "user" variable.
     \end{enumerate}
     \item \textbf{Working with Blade templating engine:}
     \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Blade syntax:}
        
        Blade provides a convenient and expressive syntax for working with views.
        
        For example, you can use the `{{ }}` syntax to echo variables or the `@if`, `@foreach`, and `@endif` directives for conditional statements and loops.
        \item \textbf{Blade directives:}
        
        Blade offers several directives to enhance the templating experience.
        
        Examples of directives include:
         
        `@extends('layout')`: Specifies that the view extends a layout template.
        
        `@section('content')`: Defines a section within the view.
        
        `@yield('content')`: Renders the content of a section defined in the layout.
        
        `@include('partial')`: Includes a partial view.
        
        `@if`, `@else`, `@elseif`, `@endif`: Conditionally execute code.
        
        `@foreach`, `@endforeach`: Iterate over a collection.
    
        \item \textbf{Layouts and master templates:}
        
        Layouts allow you to define the common structure and elements shared across multiple views, typically, a layout template contains the HTML structure, header, footer, and placeholders for dynamic content, by extending a layout, you can inject specific content into the predefined sections.
        
        Here's an example of a layout template named `layout.blade.php`:
        \begin{verbatim}
            <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>@yield('title')</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <header>
             <!-- Common header content -->
         </header>

         <div class="content">
             @yield('content')
         </div>

         <footer>
             <!-- Common footer content -->
         </footer>
     </body>
     </html>
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
By utilizing views and Blade templates in Laravel, we could achieve a clean separation of concerns between the user interface and other application like conntrollers and its methods.
\subsection{Models and Eloquent ORM}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Models:}

Models are used to represent the data and business logic of a web application, it allows developers to interact with the application's database in a more intuitive and object-oriented way, rather than writing raw SQL queries.

In the context of the CNAS virtual counter, models would be used to represent the various entities in the system, such as users, appointments, and requests. For example, a User model might represent the attributes and behavior of a user in the system, such as their name, email, and username.

To create a model in Laravel, we used the Artisan command-line tool to generate a new class that extends Laravel's base Model class. This new class represents a table in the application's database, and includes methods for interacting with the table's data.

For example, to create a User model we use the artisan command : 
\begin{verbatim}
    php artisan make:model User
\end{verbatim}
This generates a new User.php file in the "app" directory of the Laravel project, which contains the basic structure of a model class, we can add new methods if needed .

The overall structure of a modal is : 
\begin{verbatim}
    class User extends Model
    {
        public function posts()
        {
            return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
        }
    }

    class Post extends Model
    {
        public function user()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
        }
    }
\end{verbatim}
\item \textbf{Eloquent ORM: }

In Laravel, Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is the default database system used to interact with database tables and records. Eloquent provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with database tables using PHP code, making it easier and more efficient to work with data in a Laravel application.

Some of the most commonly used Eloquent methods include:
\begin{itemize}
     
    \item \textbf{all()} - Retrieves all records from a database table.
    
    \item \textbf{find()} - Retrieves a single record from a database table by its primary key.
    
    \item \textbf{create()} - Inserts a new record into a database table.

    \item \textbf{update()} - Updates one or more records in a database table.

    \item \textbf{delete()} - Deletes one or more records from a database table.

    \item \textbf{where()} - Filters records based on specific criteria.

    \item \textbf{orderBy()} - Sorts records based on a specific field.

    \item \textbf{limit()} - Limits the number of records returned by a query.

    \item \textbf{join()} - Joins multiple tables together in a query.

    \item \textbf{select()} - Specifies which fields to include in a query result.
\end{itemize}
In addition to these basic methods, Eloquent also provides many more advanced features, such as relationships between tables. 

There are four types of relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. Each relationship type can be defined using methods on the model class that corresponds to the related table.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{One-to-One Relationship:}
    
    In a one-to-one relationship, a record in one table is related to exactly one record in another table. For example, a user might have a single profile record that contains additional information about the user. In Eloquent, a one-to-one relationship can be defined using the "hasOne" and "belongsTo" methods.
    \item \textbf{One-to-Many Relationship:}
    
    In a one-to-many relationship, a record in one table can be related to many records in another table. For example, a user might have many posts in a blog application. In Eloquent, a one-to-many relationship can be defined using the "hasMany" and "belongsTo" methods.
    \item \textbf{Many-to-One Relationship:}
    
    A many-to-one relationship is essentially the opposite of a one-to-many relationship. In a many-to-one relationship, many records in one table can be related to a single record in another table. For example, many posts might belong to a single user in a blog application. In Eloquent, a many-to-one relationship can be defined using the "belongsTo" and "hasMany" methods.
    \item \textbf{Many-to-Many Relationship:}
    
    In a many-to-many relationship, many records in one table can be related to many records in another table. For example, a user might have many roles in an application, and each role might be associated with many users. In Eloquent, a many-to-many relationship can be defined using the "belongsToMany" method.
\end{itemize}
After implementing those relations on the application tables, now we can retrieve data from multiple tables with one function seamlessly and with ease, by using with() function.

This feature reduces the number of database queries required to retrieve data and improves the performance of the application.
\end{itemize}
Overall, Eloquent ORM offers a full range of techniques and capabilities that make working with database tables and records in a Laravel application simple and effective. we can create code that is easier to comprehend, extend over time, and is cleaner, more maintainable, and more extensible by utilizing Eloquent to communicate with the database.
